# Theatre-Ticket-System

In this system, i use loops, functions, if statements, and more. this system allows you to pick a row and a seat within a movie theatre. once a seat is chosen, it is marked with an X, and is unable to be chosen again. furthermore, if the player types all, all seats are booked, and the code ends. to end the code manually, type exit, and the code stops.
